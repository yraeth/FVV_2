%% This is an example for writing a paper at the IVT.
%% It supports English and German language.
%% By using it, it is possible to switch paper layouts easily
%% (e.g., working paper style into TRB style)
%%
%% The easiest way to write you own paper is to create an
%% appropriate directory stucture in the papers subdirectory
%% i.e. papers/strc/2007/mypaper,
%% copy this template and modify it there.
%%
%% See the note below on renaming the main file.
%%
%% Each keyword is documented. Just follow the instructions...
%% Enjoy!

%% IMPORTANT NOTE ON FILE RENAMES:
%%   If you rename this file, look for the text "Template"
%%   in all files and change this to the new filename, too.
%%   There is a script that will do this for you in
%%   Linux/Windows+cygwin or Mac OS X: Simply execute
%%
%%       _latexfiles/tools/rename.sh Assignment NewName
%%
%%   Substitute NewName with a name of your choice.
%%
%%   In Windows, use your favorite find-in-text-files tool
%%

%% ABSTRACT (first language)
%%   You can write it just here, if you want. You can also include
%%   an external .tex file (for better organization of you paper)
%%   The abstract MUST always be embedded into a command:
%%     \createabstract{
%%     This is an
%%     example abstract.
%%     }
%%   Be sure that your abstract is embedded into the curly brackets.
%%
%%   You can also put the abstract in a seperate .tex file for better
%%   organization. The command then is:
%%     \input{abstract-first}
%%   see also below (include sections)
%\createabstract{Abstract in the first language}
%%\input{abstract-first}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The following is necessary only if you provide an abstract in the
%%   other language (e.g. a German abstract for a paper written
%%   in English)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ABSTRACT (second language)
%% You need to define the language for the following abstract...
%\switchlanguage
%%   Same as above
%\createabstract{Zusammenfassung in der Zweitsprache}
%%\input{abstract-second}
%% reset to the default language
